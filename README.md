I initially broken down how pieces I would need to create to build the password generator. 

I first set up the prompts and confirms for the questions. Then I console.log the responses so I knew that it was working. 

I also built the corresponding arrays to the confirms. I then also defined intermediate array, array length (since that can vary), and the final Array which will hold our password. 

// To Do: 
// Create generatePassword function and returns all of my code should live inside this code
// Create a series of prompts:
// 1. var= Prompt-length of password (validation: 8-128 characters) (save to variable)
// 2.Confirm-Special Characters?
// 3.Confirm-Numeric Characters?
// 4.Confirm-UpperCase Characters?
// 5.Confirm-LowerCharacters?

// Create arrays with all needed characters (lowercase, lowercase, numeric and special)

// create a new var that holds all of the chosen characters

// create a conditional situational that saves the choisen char from our confirm statement


// We have to select the spefic # of char randomly from our collection based on user answer to 1st prompt 
// Add loop that encompasses arrays and is dedicated by first prompt

// create a new array with to hold final password 

// push each time to new password

// Add validations to make sure at least one type character is selected and alert the user that they need to chose 

// Add event listener to generate button

// add validation to after logic
